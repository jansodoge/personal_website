Hi there!
I'm a PhD student at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Resarch, trained computational social scientist,
interested in the intersections of human and the environment (socio-ecological systems).

My PhD research focuses on assessing, modeling, and understanding the impacts of natural
hazards (specifically droughts) on social-ecological systems. I apply text mining,
machine learning and natural language processing, and participatory modeling.


Next to my academic work, I'm deeply interested in sports analytics by the means of large-scale data analysis 
and the integration of computational tools to journalism.
